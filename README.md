**analytix** — the swiss army knife TUI for your terminal. Built with Go and Bubbletea, it puts everything you need to know about your machine and network in one place: CPU, RAM, disk I/O, temperatures, processes, live logs, open connections, LAN scanning, port scanning, MAC spoofing, and security tooling. You can also find analytix on __[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/kikikian/analytix)__.
